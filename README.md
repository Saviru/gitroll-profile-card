# GitRoll Profile Card

We now have 7 preset themes to choose from! ðŸŽ‰

- `light` (the default one)
- `dark`
- `sepia`
- `solarizedLight`
- `solarizedDark`
- `tokyoNight`
- `nord`

To use a preset theme, simply add the `theme` query parameter to the image URL.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to GitRoll Profile Card!

However, since we want to keep this project simple and easy to use, before any new themes are added, we require the PR to have at least **3 emoji reactions** from the community. This is to ensure that the new theme is something that the community actually wants.

## Developing

To help you develop new themes and preview your work, please use the playground as follows:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
4. Visit the playground at <http://localhost:5173>

The playground allows you to:

- Preview your card in real-time (HMR)
- Try out different themes
- Test with custom properties, such as username, ranks, and scores

This is a great way to experiment with different configurations and see how your card will look before submitting a PR for it.
